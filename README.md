# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Insights

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped our world in unimaginable ways. Beyond the headlines and news updates, the data tells a powerful story — one of rising cases, recovery struggles, global patterns, and lessons learned.
This project is a **data-driven exploration of COVID-19**. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I have analyzed real-world datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that help us better understand the pandemic’s impact across countries and timelines.
The intention is not only to showcase **data analytics skills** but also to demonstrate how **numbers can narrate a human story**.
